AMA466 covers topics such as multivariate normal distribution, principal component analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, and canonical correlation analysis. AMA4670 covers topics such as history of epidemic and pandemic, theory and methods to model the spread of diseases in populations, likelihood-based inference and iterated filtering. Both courses are level 4 courses with 3 credit value. They have different pre-requisites: AMA466 requires Applied Statistical Methods (AMA2631/AMA2631A) or equivalent, while AMA4670 requires Probability & Distributions (AMA2691) or equivalent and Multivariable Calculus (AMA2702) or equivalent. They also use different computer packages: AMA466 uses MINITAB, SPSS and SAS, while AMA4670 uses R.",

AMA466 introduces multivariate statistical methods, which are useful for analyzing data with multiple variables, such as principal component analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis, and so on. The course also teaches how to use computer packages such as MINITAB, SPSS and SAS for data analysis. AMA4670, on the other hand, deals with modelling of epidemic and pandemic, which are scenarios where a disease spreads rapidly and widely among a population. The course covers the history of epidemic and pandemic, the theory and methods to model the spread of diseases using differential equations, demographic noise and measuremental noise, likelihood-based inference and iterated filtering. The course also requires the use of the statistical software R for disease modelling.",
